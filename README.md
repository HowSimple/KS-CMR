# About Clear My Record

The Clear My Record project team will develop a web-based application that allows a person  with a Kansas criminal conviction to determine if the crime is eligible for expungement and to  complete an application for expungement for filing with the court. The user will enter  information about the applicant and the conviction to be expunged, print a petition and  associated paperwork to file with the court, and be reminded of next steps.  

Currently, no such system exists and expungements are often processed by either hiring a lawyer  or through an expungement event hosted by Kansas Legal Service where applicants are given  their criminal conviction information and complete their own application using Microsoft Word.  We want to streamline this process and make it more accessible to residents (and attorneys)  across the state. Though we are focusing on Kansas, the application will be designed to serve  users in at least two states - Kansas and Missouri - and to allow for additional states to be added.  

# What is Expungement? 

Expungement is erasing the criminal conviction of an individual who has successfully completed the terms of sentencing and who has not had a subsequent criminal conviction within the recent past. When a conviction has been expunged, the person generally does not need to disclose the previous conviction. Some convictions are not subject to expungement. Other convictions may be subject to expungement but must be disclosed when applying for certain jobs or licenses.

# What We're Doing Now
* Taking the details of interviews conducted by Scott Stockwell and documenting them
* Creating a diagram that compares and contrasts the way different counties process expungements 

# How to Help
Those who are interested in learning more or assisting in the development of Clear My Record are encouraged to join one of Code for KC's weekly [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/KCBrigade/#:~:text=Code%20for%20KC%20is%20a,use%20technology%20for%20civic%20good.) to meet the project team and hear about the work that is currently being done.
