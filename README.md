# About Clear My Record

The Clear My Record project team will develop a web-based application that allows a person  with a Kansas criminal conviction to determine if the crime is eligible for expungement and to  complete an application for expungement for filing with the court. The user will enter  information about the applicant and the conviction to be expunged, print a petition and  associated paperwork to file with the court, and be reminded of next steps.  

Currently, no such system exists and expungements are often processed by either hiring a lawyer  or through an expungement event hosted by Kansas Legal Service where applicants are given  their criminal conviction information and complete their own application using Microsoft Word.  We want to streamline this process and make it more accessible to residents (and attorneys)  across the state. Though we are focusing on Kansas, the application will be designed to serve  users in at least two states - Kansas and Missouri - and to allow for additional states to be added.  

Clear My Record is a joint project of [Code for KC](https://codeforkc.org/) and the [UMKC School of Law](https://law.umkc.edu/). Code for KC is a local brigade associated with Code for America and provides assistance to governmental and non-profit entities to improve the operation of government and non-profit services. Code for KC is affiliated locally with KC Digital Drive. The University of Missouri - Kansas City School of Law has been serving the Kansas City metropolitan area for over 123 years. UMKC School of Law has programs to train its students to utilize technology to improve the delivery of professional legal serivces.

# What is Expungement? 

Expungement is erasing the criminal conviction of an individual who has successfully completed the terms of sentencing and who has not had a subsequent criminal conviction within the recent past. When a conviction has been expunged, the person generally does not need to disclose the previous conviction. Some convictions are not subject to expungement. Other convictions may be subject to expungement but must be disclosed when applying for certain jobs or licenses.

# Project Outline

The Clear My Record project began in August 2021, and will continue through the end of July 2023. Key quarterly milestones are listed below:

* Quarter 1 (est. August 1-October 31) 
    * Document workflows for defendants, attorneys, KLS, prosecutors, and courts; Analyze  the documented workflows and develop possible solutions for prototyping 
    * Interview people who have experienced the expungement system 
    * Establish working relationships with collaborative partners; Establish documentation  system; Develop a journey map documentation process 
* Quarter 2 (est. November 1-January 31) 
    * Define current process and experience; ideate improvements to address pain points;  Create initial prototypes to test hypotheses developed 
    * Schedule opportunities to observe expungement events and test prototypes; Identify and  establish web resources for communicating about design process 
    * Outreach to KS Supreme Court and judicial administration to mirror structural conversations about expungement happening in Missouri; Outline possible training  materials for volunteer attorneys 
* Quarter 3 (est. February 1-April 30)  
    * Field test initial prototypes; Design a process to capture longitudinal information of users  of tools being created and possible control groups (follow users over an extended period) 
    * Complete a design thinking cycle to capture the benefit of the initial field testing
    * Prepare prototypes for use in events and produce training materials for volunteers 
    * Explore with data management agencies integration of application with existing resources 
* Quarter 4 (est. May 1-July 31) 
    * Utilize and observe use of prototypes in major expungement events; Identify classes of  users and their respective resource requirements; Refine description of data architecture  necessary to support the application 
    * Design website tool as adjunct to expungement event; Feature project in KCDD and KC  Legal Hackersâ€™ Legal Tech Speaker Series; Begin discussions about long-term plan for  sustaining continued development of the app 
* Quarter 5 (est. August 1-October 31)
    * Refine and finalize development plan; Accelerate process of wireframing application  and test wireframe prototypes; Accelerate software development for alpha testing 
* Quarter 6 (est. November 1-January 31)
    * Primary alpha testing combined with active software iterative development; Advance  towards beta dev. and testing; Refine documentation system to establish version control  and development process 
* Quarter 7 (est. February 1-April 30)  
    * Active beta software testing and refinement, release and test of 1.0 version; Revise web based tool capturing engineering insights from the app development process; Establish  development plan and calendar for future versions; Invite KCDD Internet Access Support  Plan clients to apply for expungement support 
* Quarter 8 (est May 1-July 31) 
    * Implementation and Use of 1.0 version of application in expungement clinics; Complete a  1.1 version creation cycle; Document reporting on learnings from project to share with  collaboration partners
